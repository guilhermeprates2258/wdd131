                    <p>
                        My name is Guilherme Prates. I am a dynamic and results-driven professional with solid experience in data analysis, financial reconciliation, and strategic support in marketplaces. 
                        Throughout my career, I have worked in large companies, taking on responsibilities such as resolving discrepancies, delivering analytical and financial reports, and developing solutions to optimize processes. 
                        I have experience in client management, team leadership, and training, as well as strong skills in communication and presentation.
                        My educational background includes the BYU Pathway Connect program, and I am currently studying programming to expand my technical skills. I also have meaningful experiences, such as serving as a financial secretary in a volunteer organization and participating in a humanitarian mission in Northeast Brazil, where I developed empathy, resilience, and strategic planning skills. I am driven by continuous learning and applying knowledge to create a positive impact.
